# Assignment:
Break down the process of how to get food at a restaurant. Use the same process and notation that we used during Session 5 (how to make tea). We are leaving this description intentionally vague so that you can choose what angle you feel most comfortable with. Although we are not looking for a specific "answer" for how you break this down, you should be as detailed as possible. It is better to break things down too much than to oversimplify a process.
